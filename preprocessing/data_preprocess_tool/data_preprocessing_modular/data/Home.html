  Sorry guys, but marking is dragging on and on and on and on and on ...
 
 
  It's unlikely that we'll have the final marks in by the deadline for us to submit marks. This means that you will all likely end up with a grade of "LE" for the course when marks are published. All that this means is "You lecturer didn't get marks in on time"; it's not a problem with anything you've done.
 
 
  In the meantime, lab and assignment marks will gradually appear via sturec or Webcms3 or however else you check your marks. If you have a problem with any mark, send me email and I'll add it to my TODO list, and it will all get cleaned up once marks are finalised.
 
 
  Let me be more precise about timings
 
 
  
   final marks need to be submitted by November 26 to make it into the December 5 release of results
  
  
   your marks will probably be finalised around December 2/3/4
  
  
   even if I "handed them in" on December 3, they won't make it through "the system" in time for December 5 release
  
  
   I will post final results on the web site as soon as we know them</p><h3 >字段3</h3><p>Final Exam

  Hmm ... looks like it was a bit long/hard ...
 
 
  Don't panic ... if the results are overall bad, I'll scale up.</p><h3 >字段4</h3><p>Final Exam Details
